**Huffman File Compression**

Overview
This Python program implements Huffman's algorithm for file compression. Huffman's algorithm is a widely used method for lossless data compression. It works by assigning variable-length codes to input characters based on their frequencies, with the goal of minimizing the total number of bits required to represent the input data.

Features
Compresses input files using Huffman's algorithm.
Decompresses previously compressed files.
Efficiently handles both text and binary files.
Provides options for specifying input and output file paths.
